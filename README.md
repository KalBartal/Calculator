# Calculator

This is my coding challenge submission for day #10 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp, instructor-led training.

Welcome to Simple Python Calculator! This project provides a simple calculator written in Python 3. Here's what basic calculator does:

- adds two numbers together
- subtracts one number from another
- multiplies two numbers
- divides one number by another

## Usage

The calculator can be used by typing the following command in the terminal:

```
python main.py
```

Once you have executed the command, the calculator will display a logo in the terminal, and then prompt you for the first number:

```
What's the first number?: 10
```

Next, the calculator will display a list of available operations, and then prompt you to pick an operation:

```
+
-
*
/
Pick an operation: *
```

Finally, the calculator will prompt you to enter the second number:

```
What's the next number?: 5
```

Once you have entered both numbers, the calculator will perform the operation and will display the result:

```
10 * 5 = 50
```

The calculator will then prompt you to continue calculating with the result, or to start a new calculation:

```
Type 'y' to continue calculating with 50, or type 'n' to start a new calculation: n
```

If you choose to start a new calculation, the calculator will clear the terminal, and will start again from the logo.
